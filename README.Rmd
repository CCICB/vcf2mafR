**vcf2mafR** converts vcf files and vcf-like dataframes to MAF files

This is an **unofficial** R implementation of VCF to MAF mapping, and is inspired by the official perl implementation: [vcf2maf]( https://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf). 

**vcf2mafR** implements only a subset of the functionality available in [vcf2maf]( https://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf), so we recommend any users who don't require a native R solution to use the original!


## Installation

You can install the development version of vcf2mafR like so:

``` r
# install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('CCICB/vcf2mafR')
```


## Conversions

* `df2maf` : Converts VCF-like data.frames to MAF format
* `vcf2maf`: Converts VCF files to MAF format
